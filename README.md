# Basic R programs for Statistics Class

## Overview
These programs are being written for a statistics class that I am currently taking at my university. The repository will be updated throughout the course as I work on different statistical concepts and analyses using R. Topics covered will include probability, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression, and more.
