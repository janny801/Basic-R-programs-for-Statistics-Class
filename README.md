# Basic R programs for Statistics Class

## Overview
These programs are being written for a statistics class that I am currently taking at my university. The repository will be updated throughout the course as I work on different statistical concepts and analyses using R. Topics covered will include probability, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression, and more.

### Prerequisites
To run these programs, you need to have R installed on your system. You can download it from the official CRAN website:  
[https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

You can use either **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** or **RStudio** to run these scripts:

- **VS Code** requires additional setup, including installing extensions and configuring the R language server (see below).
- **RStudio** is an alternative that comes with built-in support for running R scripts, visualizing plots, and managing projects, making it a convenient choice for many users.
